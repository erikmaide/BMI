# BMI Calculator 💪

## My Goal

The objective of this repository is to look at how I can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve my own beautiful user interface designs. If  I have a designer on board, no matter how unconventional their designs are, I can create them using Flutter.


## What I will create

I´m going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.
